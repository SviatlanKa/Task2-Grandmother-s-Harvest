                <p>Perhaps it's the intense color variety, or maybe it's the flavor that gives it away, but bell peppers have more than their share of vitamins and minerals. Regular consumption of foods rich in vitamin C, like green peppers, for instance, which contain more than twice the vitamin C of an orange, helps protect against scurvy, boosts the immune system, lowers inflammation in the arteries that leads to heart disease, diabetes, and cholesterol build up, and scavenges harmful free radicals from the body. Other nutritional benefits of bell peppers include thiamin, niacin, folate, magnesium, and copper.</p>
                <p>USDA studies showed that the vitamin K (phylloquinone) content in peppers, including hot varieties, may affect blood coagulation, and may also play a role in protecting against osteoporosis, since patients with reduced bone density show lower levels of this nutrient.1 Interestingly enough, sautéed peppers contain higher amounts of vitamin K than raw peppers.</p>

                <p>Vitamin C, the most active vitamin in fennel (17% of the daily value), has the strength to zap free radicals looking for a place to cause damage in the body, usually in the form of inflammation, which could lead to joint degeneration and arthritis. Other prominent vitamins and minerals in fennel include potassium, an electrolyte that fights high blood pressure, and folate, which helps convert potentially dangerous molecules called homocysteine into a benign form.</p>
                <p>The dietary fiber in fennel limits cholesterol build-up, absorbs water in the digestive system, and helps eliminate carcinogens from the colon, possibly preventing colon cancer. Several other nutrients play supportive roles, namely manganese, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and copper.</p>

                <p>While eggplants don't have an overwhelming supply of any one nutrient, they do contain an impressive array across the board of many vitamins and minerals, such as excellent amounts of fiber, folate, potassium and manganese, as well as vitamins C, K, and B6, phosphorus, copper, thiamin, niacin, magnesium, and pantothenic acid.</p>
                <p>Modern-day scientists found that the Black Magic variety of eggplant contains nearly three times the amount of antioxidant phenolics they found in other eggplant types. Phenols are known to be one of the most powerful free radical scavengers, which can prevent cancer development and heart disease, but it's these very attributes that give eggplants a slight bitter taste.</p>

                <p>If you're looking for a vegetable with stellar amounts of antioxidants and flavonoids, green beans certainly fit the bill. Flavonoids like catechins (also found in green tea) in green beans help reduce body fat and can prevent obesity. Epicatechins improve heart health and help prevent cancer and diabetes, and the procyanidins in beans provide even more antioxidants.</p>
                <p>Green beans also are a great source of vitamin A and antioxidants, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and betacarotenes, which neutralize harmful free radicals. Vitamin C helps fight infection, such as in colds or flu, fiber helps keep your system flushed from toxins, and the carotene zeaxanthin protects eye health from UV rays by absorbing into the retina and helping to protect against macular degeneration.</p>

                  Like most fruits and vegetables, jalapeño peppers are a good source of fiber. One pepper provides 2% of the RDI for a person consuming 2,000 calories per day.</p>
                  <p>Jalapeños also contain lots of vitamin C and vitamin B6. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage and keeps your skin healthy and firm, while vitamin B6 is an essential nutrient involved in over 140 bodily reactions. One of the most unique compounds in jalapeños is capsaicin, an alkaloid that gives peppers their characteristic spicy quality and is responsible for many of their health benefits.</p>

                  <p>Carrots contain many plant compounds, but the carotenoids are by far the best known. These are substances with powerful antioxidant activity, and have been linked to improved immune function and reduced risk of many diseases. This includes cardiovascular disease, various degenerative diseases, and certain types of cancer. Beta-carotene, the main carotene in carrots, can be converted to vitamin A in the body. However, there is some individual variability in how effective this conversion process is. Eating fat with the carrots can also help you absorb more of the beta-carotene.</p>

                  <p>Potatoes are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, particularly potassium and vitamin C. The levels of some vitamins and minerals drop during cooking, but this reduction can be minimized by baking or boiling them with the skin on.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Potassium. The predominant mineral in potatoes, potassium is concentrated in the skin and may benefit heart health.</li>
                    <li>Vitamin C. The main vitamin found in potatoes, vitamin C is significantly reduced with cooking — but leaving the skin on appears to reduce this loss.</li>
                    <li>Folate. Concentrated in the peel, folate is mostly found in potatoes with colored flesh.</li>
                    <li>Vitamin B6. A class of B vitamins involved in red blood cell formation, B6 is found in most foods. Deficiency is rare.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Potatoes are rich in bioactive plant compounds, which are mostly concentrated in the skin. Varieties with purple or red skin and flesh contain the highest amounts of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Chlorogenic acid. This is the main polyphenol in potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Catechin. An antioxidant that accounts for about 1/3 of total polyphenol content, catechin is highest in purple potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Lutein. Found in potatoes with yellow flesh, lutein is a carotenoid antioxidant that may boost eye health.</li>
                    <li>Glycoalkaloids. A class of toxic phytonutrients produced by potatoes as a natural defense against insects and other threats, glycoalkaloids may have harmful effects in large amounts.</li>

                <p>Free radicals are molecules produced by your body’s metabolic process. Though highly unstable, they have useful roles, such as destroying harmful bacteria. However, excessive free radicals in your body create a state called oxidative stress, which has been linked to chronic illnesses, including heart disease and cancer. Pumpkins contain antioxidants, such as alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. These can neutralize free radicals, stopping them from damaging your cells. Test-tube and animal studies have shown that these antioxidants protect skin against sun damage and lower the risk of cancer, eye diseases and other conditions.</p>
                <p>Pumpkin is loaded with nutrients that can boost your immune system. For one, it’s high in beta-carotene, which your body turns into vitamin A. Studies show that vitamin A can strengthen your immune system and help fight infections. Conversely, people with a vitamin A deficiency can have a weaker immune system. Pumpkin is also high in vitamin C, which has been shown to increase white blood cell production, help immune cells work more effectively and make wounds heal faster. Aside from the two vitamins mentioned above, pumpkin is also a good source of vitamin E, iron and folate — all of which have been shown to aid the immune system as well.</p>

                  <p>Antioxidants are compounds that help protect your cells from the harmful effects of free radicals and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress contributes to aging, chronic inflammation and many diseases, including cancer. Asparagus, like other green vegetables, is high in antioxidants. These include vitamin E, vitamin C and glutathione, as well as various flavonoids and polyphenols. Asparagus is particularly high in the flavonoids quercetin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol.</p>
                  <p>These substances have been found to have blood pressure-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anticancer effects in a number of human, test-tube and animal studies. What’s more, purple asparagus contains powerful pigments called anthocyanins, which give the vegetable its vibrant color and have antioxidant effects in the body. In fact, increasing anthocyanin intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of heart attacks and heart disease. Eating asparagus along with other fruits and vegetables can provide your body with a range of antioxidants to promote good health.</p>
